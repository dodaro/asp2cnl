A node is identified by an id.
A color is identified by an id.
A connected_to is identified by a first node, and by a second node.
An assigned_to is identified by a node, and by a color.
Whenever there is a node with id equal to 3, whenever there is a node with id X equal to 2 then we must have a connected_to with first_node equal to 3, with second_node X.
