timemax is a constant equal to 90.
Whenever there is a isLinked with first_joint J2, with second_joint J1 then we must have a isLinked with first_joint J1, with second_joint J2.
Whenever there is a time with time T less than timemax then we can have at most 1 changeAngle with first_joint J1, with second_joint J2, with first_angle A, with second_angle AI, with time T such that there is a joint with id J1, a joint with id J2, a angle with angle_value A, a hasAngle with joint id J1, with angle angle_value AI, with time T, a isLinked with first_joint J1, with second_joint J2, where J1 is greater than J2, where A is different from AI, where T is greater than 0.
It is prohibited that there is a changeAngle with first_joint J1, with second_joint J2, with first_angle A, with second_angle AI, with time T, whenever there is not a ok with first_joint J1, with second_joint J2, with first_angle A, with second_angle AI, with time T.
Whenever there is a changeAngle with first_joint J2, with first_angle A, with second_angle AP, with time T, whenever there is a hasAngle with joint id J1 greater than J2, with angle angle_value AC, with time T, whenever there is a angle with angle_value AN equal to |(AC+(A-AP))+360|, whenever there is a time with time T then we must have a affected with joint id J1, with first_angle AN, with second_angle AC, with time T.
Whenever there is a changeAngle with first_joint J1, with first_angle A, with time T then we must have a hasAngle with joint id J1, with angle angle_value A, with time T+1.
Whenever there is a affected with joint id J1, with first_angle A, with time T then we must have a hasAngle with joint id J1, with angle angle_value A, with time T+1.
Whenever there is a hasAngle with joint id J1, with angle angle_value A, with time T less than or equal to timemax, whenever there is not a changeAngle with first_joint J1, with time T, whenever there is not a affected with joint id J1, with time T then we must have a hasAngle with joint id J1, with angle angle_value A, with time T+1.
It is prohibited that there is a goal with joint id J, with angle angle_value A, whenever there is not a hasAngle with joint id J, with angle angle_value A, with time equal to timemax.
