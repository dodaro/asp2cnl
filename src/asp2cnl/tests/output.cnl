A joint is identified by an id.
An angle is identified by an angle value.
A goal is identified by a joint, and by an angle.
A isLinked is identified by a first joint, and by a second joint.
A time is a temporal concept expressed in steps ranging from 0 to 10.
An affected is identified by a joint, by a first angle, by a second angle, and by a time.
A hasAngle is identified by a joint, by an angle, and by a time.
A changeAngle is identified by a first joint, by a second joint, by a first angle, by a second angle, and by a time.
A ok is identified by a first joint, by a second joint, by a first angle, by a second angle, and by a time.
//timemax is a constant equal to 90.

A position is identified by a joint, by an angle, and by a time.
A link is identified by a first joint, and by a second joint.
A rotation is identified by a first joint, by a second joint, by a desired angle, by a current angle, and by a time.
granularity is a constant equal to 90.

Whenever there is a changeAngle with first_joint J2, with first_angle A, with second_angle AP, with time T, whenever there is a hasAngle with joint id J1 greater than J2, with angle angle_value AC, with time T, whenever there is a angle with angle_value AN equal to |(AC+(A-AP))+360|, whenever there is a time with time T then we must have a affected with joint id J1, with first_angle AN, with second_angle AC, with time T.
