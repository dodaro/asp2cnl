Whenever there is a node with id ND_D, with weight ND_WGHT then we can have exactly 1 assigned_to with sourcenode ND_D, with targetnode ST_D, with weight ND_WGHT such that there is a set with id ST_D.
It is prohibited that there is a node with id NA, with weight SSGND_T_WGHT, whenever there is a assigned_to with sourcenode NA, with targetnode A, with weight SSGND_T_WGHT, whenever there is a node with id NB, with weight SSGND_T_WGHTA, whenever there is a assigned_to with sourcenode NB, with targetnode A, with weight SSGND_T_WGHTA, whenever there is a set with id A, whenever there is a edge with sourcenode NA, with targetnode NB.
It is prohibited that the number of sourcenode that have a assigned_to with targetnode A set A with id A is equal to Y, whenever we have that the number of sourcenode that have a assigned_to with targetnode B set B with id B is equal to X, where Y is less than or equal to X, where A is equal to 1, where B is equal to 2.
It is prohibited that the total weight that have a assigned_to with targetnode SB set SB with id SB is equal to X, whenever we have that , where X is less than Y, where SA is equal to 1, where SB is equal to 2.
