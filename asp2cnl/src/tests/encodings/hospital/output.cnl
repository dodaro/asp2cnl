Whenever there is a 10_min_ts with 10_min_ts T less than TS+PH4, whenever there is a x with registration patient RID, with day DAY, with 10_min_ts TS less than or equal to T, with duration_of_the_fourth_phase PH4 greater than 0 then we must have a res with registration id RID, with day DAY, with 10_min_ts T.
