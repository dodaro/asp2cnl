# Experiments
These are the results obtained by ASP2NL executed with ChatGPT 3.5 as LLM, and
its comparison with the baseline approach (referred to as Base), i.e., ChatGPT 3.5 executed on the plain ASP encoding. 

We selected five benchmark tests: Graph Colouring, Hamiltonian Path, Hanoi Tower, Chemotherapy Treatment Scheduling, and Nurse Scheduling.
For each benchmark you can find two files:  
`   {BENCHMARK_NAME}_Base.txt`  
`   {BENCHMARK_NAME}_ASP2NL.txt`  
containing the corresponding results.
